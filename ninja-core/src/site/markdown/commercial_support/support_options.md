Agile custom development
------------------

Agile custom development is available in two areas:

### For your project

It does not matter if you are right at the start or in the middle of a project.
We can help to staff your project with our experts. We have a proven track
record to develop and implement Ninja web projects. Usually we can offer 
remote capacities on very short notice.

### Custom features and modules for Ninja

Sometimes you need a feature in Ninja's codebase better yesterday than in some weeks time. 
If Ninja's core team  agrees that your feature request can be 
integrated into Ninja we can start implementing now. We offer competitive 
rates for the development of custom features or modules. 
Custom features will be prioritized over non paid features
and will make it into the next release of Ninja.
