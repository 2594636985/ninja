Our philosophy
==============

The Ninja team is made up of open source enthusiasts. We really
think that open source leads to better software and better value at the end.
We love to collaborate openly and share our code with the world.

On the other hand many of us are involved in businesses that actually use 
Ninja at a daily basis. Therefore we know how important it is to provide 
stable and mature support for Ninja in the long run.

Ninja provides you the best of both worlds: From an open source perspective
Ninja is distributed under the Apache 2 license. The Apache 2 license is known 
as one of the most business friendly
licenses around. Therefore Ninja will always stay under the open source domain.

From a business perspective we provide exceptional support in three areas:
 
 * Training
 * Support packages
 * Custom development
