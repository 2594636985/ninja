Our philosophy
==============

Ninja is open source and will be open source forever
----------------------------------------------------

The Ninja team is made up of open source enthusiasts. We really
think that open source leads to better software and better value for users and
businesses. We love to collaborate and share our code with the world.

On the other hand - many of us are involved in businesses that use 
Ninja at a daily basis. Ninja is a key component to earn money - for our
business backends, in consulting and more. 
Therefore we know how important it is to provide stable and mature support 
for Ninja in the long run.

To back up your business we offer commercial grade support
----------------------------------------------------------

Ninja offers you the best of both worlds!

From an open source perspective
Ninja is distributed under the Apache 2 license. The license is known 
as one of the most business friendly
licenses around. This also ensures that Ninja will always stay under 
the open source domain.

From a business perspective we provide exceptional support in three areas:
Training, Support packages and custom development.
