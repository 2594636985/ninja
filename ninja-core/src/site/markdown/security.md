Security of the Ninja
=====================

We built Ninja on standards and reused a huge amount of proven and tested
technology. But as with every software project we expect bugs and also
security issues to be found as more and more people are using Ninja.

Nothing to worry about. The Ninja team takes security really seriously. 

If you think you found a security vulnerability 
please send an email to security@ninjaframework.org
describing the issue. The Ninja team will deal with the problem instantly and get back to you.
