The team - a.k.a the Ninjas
===========================

Introduction
------------

We really invite everyone to contribute. And contribution is not only writing code,
but also improving the documentation and reporting bugs. Every tiny bit
helps!

And if you don't like what you see - feel free to fork Ninja or implement a new feature. 
Looking forward seeing you on the mailing list - we are social creatures :)

By the way - Ninja is Open Source and licensed under the business friendly Apache 2.0 license.


Hall of fame
------------

Ninja is currently supported by [FinalFrontierLabs](http://www.finalfrontierlabs.com) 
and led by [Raphael](http://raphaelbauer.com).

But Ninja will never be a one man show. Fortunately a lot of great 
people joined the project and contributed excellent stuff :) 

Ninja is standing on the shoulder of giants. 
We are using an immense amount of libraries and ideas from open source projects.
Especially ideas from Rails, Play 1 and Play 2 and also 
libraries from Apache, Google, Sun/Oracle and many others.

This is the time to say **Thank you**. We hope we can contribute a bit back to the world.
