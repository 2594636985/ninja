Commercial support
==================

Our philosophy
--------------

Ninja is licensed as Apache 2 which is known as one of the most business friendly
licenses around.

We are really open source affienados. But not because we are especially nice 
people - it's only because Open source leads to better software. And this is
good for you.

Therefore Ninja will always stay under the open source domain.

Our philosophy is that Ninja will always stay under the Open Source domain. There
are no plans to cap functionality for Pro users or anything alike. The reason behind
that rationale is really simple: The more people use Ninja - the better Ninja
will get. Better plugins, better reports, a better ecosytems and much more.

For business owners this means that your investment into a new technology will
not turn into something nasty.
