        <p>Generate a new project via our Maven archetype, import it into your favorite IDE with one click and start
        coding. Ninja features a hot reloading mode that will pick up all your changes
        immediately. Features? All there, Html, Xml, Json, JPA, caching and much more.</p>

        <h2><img class="bs-icon"  src="images/glyphicons/glyphicons_082_roundabout.png"/> Testing</h2>
        <p>Ninja is fully equipped with an extensive set of test tools. Run mocked tests or test your
        complete application on a real server. Running selenium tests? All included. And the best is that
        your tests will run locally and also on any continuous integration server.

        <h2><img class="bs-icon" src="images/glyphicons/glyphicons_155_show_thumbnails.png"/> Deployment</h2>
        <p>Package Ninja applications as war and run them
        on your Tomcat or Jetty if you like. Or package your application as self contained jar that you can copy
        to your server and execute. Ninja also runs Heroku, App Engine and many other cloud providers.

        <h2><img class="bs-icon" src="images/glyphicons/glyphicons_079_podium.png"/> Solid technology</h2>
        <p>Ninja did not reinvent the wheel - instead we are standing on the shoulders of giants.
        Ninja is built using the most mature and solid technologies in the industry. 
        Servlets, Guice, JPA, Flyway migrations and Maven - just to name a few.

        <h2><img class="bs-icon" src="images/glyphicons/glyphicons_082_roundabout.png"/> Scalability built in</h2>
        <p>Ninja uses the share nothing approach. Servers do not share any common session information. That
        means you can scale Ninja horizontally with ease.
        </p>

        <p>
        You get all goodies that make Java great: Excellent IDE support.
        A statically typed language. Huge and mature eco-system. 
        First class testing support and much much more. Ninja is licensed under Apache 2.0 license. That means the codebase will be open forever.
