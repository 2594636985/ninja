		<h2>Fun and Productive</h2>
		<p>Ninja uses a lot of best practises to make your development cycles super-fast.
		For you that means two things. First: Developing with Ninja is responsive and fun. Second:
		Developing with Ninja saves your business a lot of money because devs don't have to wait until
		stuff gets restarted</p>

		<h2>Ready to start</h2>
		<p>Ninja is a full stack and you don't have to setup anything in addition. Ninja has
			built-in support for Guice, simple templating and ultrafast reload cycles.
			Most importantly it has support for fast mocked tests, integration tests to selenium
			tests running on a real browser. It's all there.</p>

		<h2>Conventions!</h2>
		<p>Convention over configuration. We designed Ninja to be 
			usable in 99% of the cases without any additional configuration. 
			That speeds up development right from the start. And for the last 1% you can of 
			course configure everything yourself. Just in case...</p>

		<h2>Powerful build system</h2>
		<p>Maven is one of the best build and library management systems out there. And
			Ninja is built for it. Even better: Automating your builds in Jenkins
			becomes as easy as telling Jenkins your repository location.</p>

		<h2>Java only</h2>
		<p>Ninja makes it easier to use all your favorite IDEs, build
			systems and libraries from the Java world. Code completion, error checking while you type,
			excellent refactoring support. That's what Ninja is.</p>

		<h2>Rock solid technology</h2>
		<p>Many companies are using Jetty or Tomcat or any other war container to host their 
		applications. And the reason is simple: Jetty and Tomcat are fast, stable and just
		fun to use. Ninja is 100% compatible with all traditional servlet containers.</p>
