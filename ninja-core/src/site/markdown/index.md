        <h2>Stable technology</h2>
        <p>Ninja did not reinvent the wheel - instead we are standing on the shoulders of giants.
        Ninja is built using the most stable technologies in the industry. Servlets, Guice dependency injection, JPA and Maven - just to name
        a few.

        <h2>Scalability</h2>
        <p>Ninja uses the share nothing approach. Servers do not share any common session information. That
        means you can scale Ninja horizontally with ease.
        </p>

        <h2>Ready to start</h2>
        <p>Ninja is a full stack. From quick development to perfectly fine testing to easy deployment. 
        And by the way - if you want you can use any servlet container or even Ninja's Jetty based standalone mode to run your application.

		<h2>Powerful build system</h2>
		<p>Maven is one of the best build and library management systems out there. And
			Ninja is built for it. Even better: Automating your builds in Jenkins
			becomes as easy as telling Jenkins your repository location. Ninja and our test framework is made for it.</p>
