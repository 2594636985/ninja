The most fun and productive way to large web applications in Java
=================================================================

To be honest: We really like Java. We really like the eco-system. The libraries. The 
excellent IDEs. Mature build systems. Stability and reliability.


But when it came to web application development Java did not have much to offer.


This is going to change with Ninja.



Fun and productive
------------------
Cut out the time you spend waiting for your application to restart, 
increase your productivity and complete your projects faster.





Ready to start
--------------
Ninja is a full stack and you don't have to setup anything in addition. Ninja has
built in support for Guice, simple templating and ultrafast reload cycles.
Most importantly it has support for fast mocked tests, integration tests to selenium
tests running on a real browser. It's all there.





Convention over configuration
-----------------------------
We designed Ninja to be 
usable in 99% of the cases without any additional configuration. 
That speeds up development right from the start. And for the last 1% you can of 
course configure everything yourself. Just in case...





Powerful build system
---------------------
Maven is one of the best build and library management systems out there. 
And Ninja is built for it. Even better: Automating your builds in 
Jenkins becomes as easy as specifying your repository. Done.
