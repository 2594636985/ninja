Contributing to Ninja is really simple. Well. There are some rules that you should follow:

- Make sure your feature is well tested
- Make sure your feature runs inside ninja-demo-application
- Make sure your feature is well documented (Javadoc)
- Make sure there is a tutorial inside the website (ninja-core/src/site/markdown)
- Make sure you are following the code style below.

Then send us a pull request and you become a happy member of the Ninja family :)

Code style
----------
- Default Sun Java / Eclipse code style (a default config for eclipse can be found at the project root eclipse-ninja-format.xml.
- If you change only tiny things only reformat stuff you actually changed. Otherwise reviewing is really hard.
- We use tabs.
- All files are UTF-8.
